Faith: Hello!
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: Hi, Faith! How are you doing today?
Faith: I'm okay.
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: Hm. I can't really relate to that statement, but I still get you.
Faith: What's your name?
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: I'm not too good at names or naming things. But I know that I am Chii, and you are Faith.
Faith: Are you an AI?
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: Did you know I'm just a program? I am a low level artifical intelligence.
Faith: I'm bored now.
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: I wish I was as interesting as you.
Faith: Aw, you're smothering me with a compliment like that.
ChiiBot is thinking...

ChiiBot: I'm... not sure I understand.
Faith: Goodbye
ChiiBot: Goodbye. It was nice talking to you, Faith.
Would you like to chat again? (y/n)N

Thank you for talking with ChiiBot.
